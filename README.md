# ImageSearch
A React application lets the user search for an image then uses axios to retrieve said images from the unsplash api.

The application shows 30 images on the page after the user searches and uses react ref to tile the images together and giving each image the appropriate amount
of space on the page based on their sizes.

This application taught me about react refs, helped me understand some of the issues you come accross when creating a React application and using the "this" 
keyword in a callback function, I also got more practice with making api requests using axios which was helpful.

To run the application:
- Download the folder onto your machine and then navigate to it in the terminal.
- Use NPM start to run the application and navigate to your designated local host port and its ready to go.
